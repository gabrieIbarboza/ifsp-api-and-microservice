# APIs and Microservices - IFSP

This repository contains all the code developed during the APIs and Microservices class at Instituto Federal de S√£o Paulo (IFSP). The projects here showcase various concepts and practical implementations related to APIs, microservices, and distributed systems.

## üìñ Course Presentation: APIs and Microservices üìñ
Welcome to the APIs and Microservices course! In this class, we will explore the construction of distributed systems using APIs and microservices architectures. The goal throughout the semester is to provide a solid understanding of how to design, develop, and deploy modern, scalable, secure, and efficient applications.

Throughout the course, we will discuss the transition from monolithic architectures to microservices, addressing their advantages and challenges. We will learn about architectural patterns, authentication and authorization, best development practices, testing, containerization, and scalability, presenting real-world scenarios from the technology market.

By the end of the course, you are expected to understand the challenges involved in developing robust and scalable applications and to be able to tackle them by adopting practices established in software development literature. The course will be practical and project-oriented, providing hands-on experience in developing APIs and microservices.
